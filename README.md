First read the requirements.txt file and make sure your kali is compatible with this software.
Use Terminator in place of Terminal
Your kali should be TOR configured and Python3 running. 
Make sure you have a legit license key. Do not crack or share keys else software may not work properly.
I recommend you get a CUSTOM kali linux machine with all the requirements ALREADY installed. You can get the custom kali linux from @nsiahchris on TELEGRAM.
